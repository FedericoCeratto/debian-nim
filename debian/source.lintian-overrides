# Upstream doesn't use standard build flags, so just use hardening-wrapper - see https://github.com/Araq/Nim/issues/2128
# This is a valid use-case of hardening-wrapper as per https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=711193
nim source: build-depends-on-obsolete-package build-depends: hardening-wrapper => use dpkg-buildflags instead
